        "\n",
        "    TensorFlow:\n",
        "\n",
        "        Developed by Google, more production-oriented with TensorFlow Serving and TF Lite.\n",
        "        Uses static computation graphs (though eager execution is now default).\n",
        "        Stronger deployment support (mobile, web, edge devices).\n",
        "        Preferred for large-scale production systems.\n",

        "        Developed by Facebook, more research-friendly with dynamic computation graphs.\n",
        "        More Pythonic and intuitive for debugging.\n",
        "        Dominates academic research and rapid prototyping.\n",
        "        Preferred for experimentation and custom model architectures.\n",

        "\n",
        "    TensorFlow: Production deployment, mobile/edge AI, enterprise applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Linguistic Features: spaCy provides pre-trained models for POS tagging, NER, and dependency parsing, unlike basic string ops.\n",
        "    Efficiency: Optimized for large-scale text processing (written in Cython).\n",
        "    Rule-Based Matching: Advanced pattern matching (e.g., Matcher, PhraseMatcher) beyond regex.\n",

        "1. Target Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "    Scikit-learn: Best for classical ML (linear regression, SVM, random forests).\n",
        "    TensorFlow: Designed for deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, transformers).\n",

        "2. Ease of Use for Beginners\n",
        "\n",
        "    Scikit-learn: Simpler API, fewer dependencies, better for beginners in ML.\n",

        "3. Community Support\n",
        "\n",
        "    Scikit-learn: Strong for traditional ML, well-documented, but less active in cutting-edge DL.\n",
        "    TensorFlow: Larger ecosystem (Keras, TF Hub), more industry adoption, extensive tutorials."
